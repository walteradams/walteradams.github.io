                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">PetPlate launched in August 2015, delivering on-demand freshly cooked meals for pets. I was involved with PetPlate during it’s conception, providing design and responsive front-end templates that I integrated into a Ruby on Rails framework. I continue to work with PetPlate as front-end developer, co-ordinating with the back-end development and design teams to produce a strong user experience.
<br><br>Over the last three years, PetPlate has grown rapidly, appearing on ABC’s Shark Tank in 2016 (USA’s version of Dragon’s Den for UK readers) and soon after being acquired by an accelerator company. In late 2018, PetPlate continues to grow with further investment and a move toward a large rebranding.</h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">When PetPlate first started in 2015, my involvement was typical of many other projects; I gave an estimate and time-scale for design and development and got the project live. Every once in a while, the founder would return to me with additional tasks or new problems that needed solving and we’d work together on a solution. In 2016, PetPlate was picked up by an accelerator company and appeared on national television. I started spending more hours on the project as the company and its requirements grew.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>As of 2018, the company now has a larger staff with development, design, and business related teams. My involvement is now predominantly as front-end developer; focusing on user experience, user behaviour research, testing, and maintenance.</div></h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">My approach as front-end developer for PetPlate is to advocate for the user, and by putting the user first, we achieve business goals as a result. Having a wide range understanding of the following can assist in achieving strong user experience:
<br><br>- What the business aims to achieve, how that effects users and how changes presented to users can achieve those goals<br><br>- User expectation and how users currently interact with a business and its website<br><br>- The technical challenges faced when adding new features to an existing platform<br><br>- Use of new technology and how that can help achieve business goals</h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Testing the PetPlate website as new features have been added has played an important part in achieving consistent growth. With each new release we’ve relied on services such as BrowserStack for cross-browser compatibility to ensure the website works across a wide range of devices from mobile to desktop.
<br><br>Our working process involves the use of smoke tests as well as release-specific tests that are carried out first by developers, then by a quality assurance team. As of 2018, we are working towards expanding our automated testing with tools such as RSpec on the back-end and Jasmine on the front-end, as well as Katalon for automation of testing UI and verifying data. We retrospectively fix bugs with use of Rollbar.</h3>

Our working process involves use of Github for code management, and Heroku for deployment, as well as its Review Apps feature for testing of features during development. We use tools such as Trello and Github issues to manage feature requests and bugs.</h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">The major problems I had to overcome in the design process were how to:<br><br>
<div>

</div><div>2. Explain the benefits of a non-typical pet food
</div><div>3. Explain the non-typical delivery process (for pet food)</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Often when buying a product online we choose to do so because we understand how it benefits us or how it’d make us feel to receive that product when buying it for another person. Engaging a potential customer in this way with the PetPlate design wasn’t possible because the product is instead purchased for a customer’s pet(s).</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The customer wouldn’t directly get satisfaction from the product so how would they benefit from it and how could that be used to present the product in a way that would engage the customer?</div><br><div>

</div><div>The PetPlate website is designed to appeal to a user’s emotion and connection to their pet. In purchasing products for our pets, we are connecting with them; we see their enjoyment and happiness, and it makes us happy too.</div></h3>

The field suggests health and nature/natural, as well as representing an environment in which both pet and owner may be happy in — on a walk for example. The image also complements the layout of the page, with the dog being in one-third, and the other two-thirds being filled with the content. Psychologically, we are more likely to look where other people/beings are looking so the dog is facing the title and call to action button to help draw the user’s eye that way too.<br><br>
